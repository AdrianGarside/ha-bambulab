# Bambu Lab

This is still a WIP.

For now, you will need the following information:
- Printer IP
- LAN Access Code (Can be found on the Printer settings)
- Serial Number (Can be found in the printer settings or in Bambu Studio)

If you are running the latest firmware which requires TLS MQTT Support, please check the `Enable TLS` box
